#This example defined a complete simulation for a SPECT application. 

The SPECT scanner is defined with the **SPECThead system**. The camera is NaI camera with 4 heads and parallel collimator. An orbiting movement of the camera and a translation movement of the bed and the phantom are defined. The is a water cylinder and the source is a gamma source of 140 keV. The acquisition is dynamic : 16 frames of 37.5 secondes each.
